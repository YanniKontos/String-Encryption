# Encryption -

# Packages, Modules: <br />
### Package: Cryptography // $ pip install cryptography 
### Modules: Random, String, Fernet <br />

### How it works:
Use of random to generate an alphanumerical password (+symbols, letters are also can be capital and non capital) comprised of 12 characters <br />
String module creates a useable alphabet which is also both capitalized and non-capitalized separately (stored in two different variables) <br />
Fernet module is used to generate an encryption key, and is also used to encrypt and decrypt certain strings used <br />
You can also choose in option : 'Y' to reveal your inputted password by providing the given encryption key
